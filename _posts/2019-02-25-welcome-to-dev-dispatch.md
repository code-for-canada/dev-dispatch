&hellip;the blog written by Code for Canada developer fellows, for developers.

One of the strengths of the civic tech movement is a culture of *openness*: we share what we're doing whenever we can.  We share our learnings, our successes, and even our failures publicly so that others can learn from them &mdash; and so that we can learn from others.  The [main Code for Canada blog](https://medium.com/code-for-canada) is (in our completely unbiased opinion) a great example of this!  You can see exactly what Code for Canada is up to, what they're planning, and what they stand for.

Each Code for Canada fellowship team keeps its own blog, providing a similar level of detail on the team's day-to-day operations:

- [Toronto Squad 2018](https://c4ctoronto2018.tumblr.com/);
- [Digital Drone Collective](http://digitaldronecollective.com/);
- [Code for Canada x PSC](https://code-for-canada.github.io/psc-updates/).

We realized, however, that these blogs were largely missing an important part of our story: the technology itself.  Making space for detailed technical content in articles written for the general public is *hard*, and so the details often get summarized, heavily digested, or even omitted.  As an example of this, [How to Use City of Toronto Map Data](https://c4ctoronto2018.tumblr.com/post/180322306391/how-to-use-city-of-toronto-map-data) is probably the most technical post on any of these blogs, and even that is *slightly* too technical for a broader audience.

Enter [Dev Dispatch](https://code-for-canada.github.io/dev-dispatch/)!  You can think of it as our *engineering blog*: a place for us Code for Canada developer fellows to share the details of our work, and for the broader tech community to see what makes civic tech tick.  We're excited to launch this blog, and hope you find the *tech* part of *civic tech* as awesome and inspiring as we do!
