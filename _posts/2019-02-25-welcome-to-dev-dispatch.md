title: Welcome to Dev Dispatch!

&hellip;the Code for Canada blog written by developers, for developers.

One of the strengths of the civic tech movement is a culture of *openness*: we work as though everyone is watching.  The [main Code for Canada blog](https://medium.com/code-for-canada) is (in our completely unbiased opinion) a great example of this!  You can see exactly what we're up to, what we're planning, and what we stand for.  Our fellowship teams keep their own blogs, providing a similar level of detail on their day-to-day operations:

- [Toronto Squad 2018](https://c4ctoronto2018.tumblr.com/);
- [Digital Drone Collective](http://digitaldronecollective.com/);
- [Code for Canada x PSC](https://code-for-canada.github.io/psc-updates/).

We realized, however, that we were missing an important part of our story: the technology itself.  Making space for detailed technical content in articles written for the general public is *hard*, and so the details often get summarized, heavily digested, or even omitted.  As an example of this, [How to Use City of Toronto Map Data](https://c4ctoronto2018.tumblr.com/post/180322306391/how-to-use-city-of-toronto-map-data) is probably the most technical post on the [Toronto Squad 2018](https://c4ctoronto2018.tumblr.com/) blog.

Enter [Dev Dispatch](https://code-for-canada.github.io/dev-dispatch/)!  You can think of it as our *engineering blog*: a place for developers at Code for Canada to share the details of their work, and for the broader tech community to see what makes civic tech tick.  We're excited to launch this blog, and hope you find the *tech* part of *civic tech* as awesome and inspiring as we do!
